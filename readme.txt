1) used in the top navigation bar, next to the search (restricted height of 20px with hidden overflow)

4) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
5) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
6) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]

it also has two menus:

footer menu
this menu is shown in the footer left hand column 

post tags:
these are bootstrap 'label' style buttons and will have different colours based on the total number of times the tag has been used across all posts / pages on your site

other things:

the theme uses bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com v3.0.4 - Apache-20 Licence http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
the theme uses font-awesome: http://fontawesome.io - SiL Open Font Licence http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

the main slider on the homepage will use your top ten posts if you have the top10 plugin installed, otherwise it will use your 10 most recent as a fallback

it gets the image from the 'featured image' against the post if it exists, if it doesnt then it uses a default image


has a theme for TW Recent Posts Widget 'yarpp' - yet another related posts plugin and it will auto include the related posts in the post page if its installed
[I suggest that you pick multiples of 3 for the number of related posts to show - 3 will be one row, 6 will be two rows]

has support for jetpack sharing plugins [and puts them in the correct position in your post if you have it installed]

category-index.php is a page template incase someone wants to make a page that displays 'all available categories in hierarchical order' - sort of a 'top level category page' - it only contains links to category archives
tag-index.php is a page template incase someone wants to make a page that displays 'all available tags in alphabetical order' - sort of a 'top level tag page' - it only displays links to tag archives
